# Image Management Application

## Setup Instructions

### Backend
1. Open `ImageManagementAPI` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Build and run the project

### Frontend
1. Navigate to `ImageManagementApp` directory
2. Run `ng serve`
3. Open `http://localhost:4200` in a web browser

## Design Decisions
- Used Angular for the frontend due to its robust component-based architecture
- Used .NET Core for the backend for its performance and scalability
- Local JSON file for data storage to simplify the setup and focus on functionality

## Application Structure
- Backend follows a clean architecture with separate layers for controllers, services, and data access
- Frontend is organized into components, services, and models for maintainability

## Future Enhancements
- Implement image search, sorting, and pagination features
- Add unit and integration tests
